# AWS-Gists

My personal collection of solutions to day-to-day I tasks in AWS

## Getting Started

Ideally, I am trying to make each script/template self-sufficient and include a README on each section to explain what I was trying to achieve. I am using my admin account in AWS so I am not explaining what permissions are required.

### Prerequisites

These scripts will require you to have:

* An AWS account
* [AWS CLI installed](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/installing.html)

```
$ pip install awscli
```
* An Access Key and Secret already configured in your AWS CLI

```
$ aws configure
```
